DISCLAIMER: TRADING RISK NOTICE

Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. 
The valuation of cryptocurrencies and futures may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose 
more than their original investment. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already 
factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small 
market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, 
leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains.

If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you 
deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources 
you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully 
understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure 
to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your 
financial advisor.

All trading strategies are used at your own risk.

This software is for educational and research purposes only. It should not be considered as 
financial advice or a recommendation to make any specific investment or trading decision. 
Always consult with qualified financial advisors before making trading decisions.
