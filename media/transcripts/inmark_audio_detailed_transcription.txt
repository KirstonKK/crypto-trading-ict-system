[00:00 - 00:01]  Hello, my dear friend.
[00:01 - 00:04]  Now I will explain to you how our forecasting algorithm works.
[00:04 - 00:08]  This is a forecasting module of the system that performs informative analysis of time
[00:08 - 00:13]  series, calculates curve parameters, and generates the coefficients necessary for calculations,
[00:13 - 00:17]  as well as time intervals for buying and selling your financial assets.
[00:17 - 00:20]  But how can all this be explained in simple terms?
[00:20 - 00:22]  This is our most important algorithm.
[00:22 - 00:27]  It works very simply, at its lowest point you buy, and at its highest point you sell.
[00:27 - 00:31]  What is its power you ask?
[00:31 - 00:32]  It predicts the future.
[00:32 - 00:35]  More precisely the exact date of the beginning of the up or down phase.
[00:35 - 00:39]  This is a clear example of how it worked and how it will work here in the future.
[00:39 - 00:43]  But when trading with it, it is important to understand some points.
[00:43 - 00:46]  From the beginning, the forecast is made using a bigger time frame, and then you go down
[00:46 - 00:48]  to smaller time frames.
[00:48 - 00:54]  That is the daily time frame, four hour time frame, hourly time frame, and 15 minutes.
[00:54 - 00:58]  On the chart, draw a vertical dotted line at the lowest or highest point of our algorithm,
[00:58 - 01:01]  which will symbolize the beginning of the growth phase, or the beginning of the decline
[01:01 - 01:03]  phase of the financial asset.
[01:03 - 01:05]  Green line went up, red line went down.
[01:05 - 01:08]  After that, you see the start date and will go down to the lower time frames, to more
[01:08 - 01:11]  accurately adjust the start of the desired phase.
[01:11 - 01:19]  You often hear me say this phrase, one to two days.
[01:19 - 01:23]  Because with the passage of time and the constant recalculations of our algorithm, as we
[01:23 - 01:27]  approach the previously set date for the start of the growth or decline phase, this date
[01:27 - 01:29]  may shift a couple of days earlier or later.
[01:29 - 01:34]  But it is precisely with this approach to forecasting, from a large time frame down to
[01:34 - 01:40]  the smallest, that we can know exactly when this day will come, and not miss it.
[01:40 - 01:45]  Similarly you can catch upward and downward movements on small time frames, such as those
[01:45 - 01:47]  here and here.
[01:47 - 01:48]  But there is another important point.
[01:48 - 01:52]  But the algorithm has done its job and, for example, moved up from the bottom, but the
[01:52 - 01:56]  price fluctuated within a small range, and if you bought the asset here, close it here
[01:56 - 01:58]  and turn in the other direction.
[01:58 - 02:01]  As we can see in this fragment.
[02:01 - 02:05]  And remember, when we are in a downtrend on a large time frame, we only sell when switching
[02:05 - 02:07]  to a small time frame.
[02:07 - 02:10]  And when we are in an uptrend, we only buy.
[02:10 - 02:12]  And here's another interesting point.
[02:12 - 02:14]  It's more about risk management.
[02:14 - 02:18]  If we see two bottoms in our mathematical model, I recommend dividing your money into equal
[02:18 - 02:22]  parts and entering the position twice, here and here.
[02:22 - 02:26]  In the next video, I will tell you why we enter a position exclusively based on our trading
[02:26 - 02:31]  filter and how it works in tandem with our forecasting module.
[02:31 - 02:35]  Also, don't forget to subscribe to all our social networks and write to me personally
[02:35 - 02:38]  or to customer support about purchasing our algorithm.
